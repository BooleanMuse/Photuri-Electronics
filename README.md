# Photuri-Electronics
VCV Rack modules made by Photuri Electronics webcomic characters, inspired on the sounds and behavior of insects.

Photuri Electronics is a mixed-media webcomic about Rebeck and Amper, two electronic magicians who mod retro toys to contact extranormal entities.

Modules included are:

## Cricketter ⊙ Cricket Sound Oscillator

This is an oscillator module simulating the sound of Crickets, it can be modulated and affected by pitch.

Cricketter generates a sound that resembles the chirping of crickets. The module has one input and one output. The input is a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that determines the pitch of the sound. The output is the generated sound.

## Fairyfly ⊙ Clock divider inspired on the Fireflies flashing behavior and Fairyfly size wings

Fairyfly simulates the behavior of a group of fireflies blinking and moving in a random pattern. The module has six outputs that correspond to the positions of the fireflies, and two additional outputs that provide information about the size and wings of a fairyfly. The module has three knobs and one input.

## Mo-Th ⊙ Moth Light Attraction Sequencer

![MothModule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98064124/223209027-80a3314b-a90c-4409-968c-1388f82ebc31.png)

Mo-Th is a four-step sequencer with a randomized behavior inspired by the attraction of moths to light.

The module has four knobs, each representing a step in the sequence. The knobs can be turned on or off by the user, and their values determine the voltage output of the corresponding output jack when the sequencer is running. There is also a randomness knob that determines the degree of randomization in the output.

The module has two inputs: a trigger input that advances the sequencer by one step each time it receives a trigger signal, and a reset input that resets the sequencer to the first step when it receives a trigger signal.

The module has five outputs: four output jacks that output a voltage corresponding to the on/off state of the four step knobs at the current step, and a fifth output jack that outputs a voltage corresponding to the current step multiplied by a random offset determined by the randomness knob.
